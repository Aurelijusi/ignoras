    <h3>Early life and education</h3>

       <p> Gere was born in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"> Philadelphia</a> on August 31, 1949,[4] the eldest son and second child of housewife Doris Ann (née Tiffany; 1924–2016) and NMIC insurance agent Homer George Gere (1922–2023).[5][6] His father originally intended to become a minister.[7] Gere was raised Methodist[8][9] in Syracuse, New York.[10] His paternal great-grandfather, George Lane Gere (1848–1932), changed the spelling of his surname from "Geer". One of his ancestors, also named George, was an Englishman who came from Heavitree and settled in the Connecticut Colony in 1638.[11] Both of Gere's parents were Mayflower descendants; his ancestors include Pilgrims such as John Billington, William Brewster, Francis Eaton, Francis Cooke, Degory Priest, George Soule and Richard Warren.[12]
        
        In 1967, he graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet.[7] He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, studying philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.[7][13]</p>

    <h4>Career</h4>

        Gere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. His first major acting role was in the original London stage version of Grease, in 1973.[7] He was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of Bent, for which he earned a Theatre World Award.
        
        Gere began appearing in Hollywood films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in The Lords of Flatbush (1974), he was replaced after fighting with his co-star Sylvester Stallone. He played a small but memorable part in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick's well-reviewed drama Days of Heaven (1978).[7] The crime drama American Gigolo (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million[14] and winning two Academy Awards out of six nominations;[15] Gere himself received his first Golden Globe Award nomination.[16] For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception.[17][18] His career rebounded with the releases of Internal Affairs (1990) and Pretty Woman (1990), the latter of which earned him his second Golden Globe Award nomination.[19] The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including Sommersby (1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), Primal Fear (1996) and Runaway Bride (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia Roberts).[17] He also took a leading role in the action thriller The Jackal (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.[20]</p>
